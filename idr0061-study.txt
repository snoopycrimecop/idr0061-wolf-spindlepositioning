Study Description	Proper spindle positioning is crucial for spatial cell division control. Spindle positioning in human cells relies on a ternary complex comprising Gαi1-3, LGN and NuMA, which anchors dynein at the cell cortex, thus enabling pulling forces to be exerted on astral microtubules. We developed a live imaging siRNA-based screen using stereotyped fibronectin micropatterns to uncover components modulating spindle positioning in human cells, testing 1280 genes, including all kinases and phosphatases. We thus discover 16 components whose inactivation dramatically perturbs spindle positioning, including Tyrosine receptor kinase 3 (TYRO3) and cyclin G associated kinase (GAK). TYRO3 depletion results in excess NuMA and dynein at the cell cortex during metaphase, as upon blocking Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which TYRO3 activates. Furthermore, depletion of GAK leads to impaired astral microtubules, as upon down-regulation of Clathrin, with which GAK interacts. Overall, our work uncovers novel components and mechanisms governing spindle positioning in human cells.

Screen Description	Live imaging screen for regulators of mitotic spindle positioning, screening a library of 1200 kinases, phosphatases and associated proteins (4 siRNAs per gene), in a 96 well format. Cells were incubated 48 hours in the presence of siRNA and than transferred to micropatterned 96 well plates containing L-shaped, fibronectin coated, micropatterns, helping to stereotype cell organelle positioning. On L-shapes, mitotic DNA (metaphase plates) are positioned in a 45° angle with respect to the arms of the Ls, thereby creating a ""reference"" phenotype. We screened for candidates whose depletion led to a significant offset from this ""reference"" or normal position during metaphase. We used HeLa cells carrying the mCherry::H2B transgene, visualizing DNA. The L-micropatterns were coated with fibronectin containing Alexa 555, thereby Ls were visible in the same fluorescent channel. After transfer of cells to micropatterned plates, cells attached within 6 hours to the micropattern. We imaged each plate for 24 hours (framerate 8min), imaging 2 visual fields per well. Each plate contained negative and positive control wells (8 scrambles siRNA wells, 8 LGN siRNA wells). Movies were analyzed using the ImageJ based algorithm TRACMIT.

Protocol Description	Growth Protocol - HeLa mCherry::H2B cells (gift from Arnaud Echard, Institut Pasteur, Paris6) were used for the screen. Cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM with GlutaMAX (Thermofisher) medium supplemented with 10% FCS in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. For live imaging, the medium was supplemented with 25mM HEPES (Thermofisher) and 1% PenStrep (Thermofisher). 	

Treatment Protocol - For reverse transfection, 20 nM (0.1 µl per well) of siRNAs were distributed in 96-well plates (Greiner Cellstar, flat bottom) using a robotic liquid handling system (Biomek F). Negative and positive control siRNAs were distributed in the outer 8 wells on each side of the 96-well plates (see Fig. 1b). 10 µl of ddH2O was added to each well for a 5 min incubation of siRNAs, and Lipofectamin RNAi Max 2000 (Invitrogen, 0.3 µl per well) was also incubated in ddH2O for 5 minutes (10 µl per well) before 10 µl of the Lipofectamin solution was added to each well for a 20 min incubation. Subsequently, ~6'000 HeLa cells expressing mCherry::H2B were seeded per well and incubated for 48 h. CYTOO 96-well imaging plates containing L-shaped micropatterns were pre-incubated at 37°C for 72 h prior to cell transfer, and then in DMEM, 10% FBS for 30 min prior to transfer. Cells were washed once in PBS and detached from the well bottom using 40µl Accutase per well for 8 min (400-600U/ml, Gibco). To stop the detachment process, DMEM, 10% FBS was then added and the cell density adjusted to 6'000/100 µl, which was determined to be the optimal number to obtain maximal coverage of micropatterns by single cells. After pipetting up and down using large aperture tips (Finntip, Thermo Fisher) to obtain a suspension of single cells, cells were transferred to the micropatterned imaging 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to settle until full attachment, which took usually 4 h, before starting live imaging, during which plates were sealed (Breathe-Easy sealing membrane, SIGMA Z380059). 	

HCS Library Protocol - We choose a library of all human kinases, phosphatases and associated proteins. Those targets are drugable and given the fast changes during mitosis it is most likely that phosphatases and kinases play key roles. 	

HCS Image Acquisition and Feature Extraction Protocol - The HeLa cell cycle lasts ~ 24 h and we thus imaged up to that duration to maximize the number of analyzable cells, finding that the percentage of cells dividing is not strikingly different than when imaging for shorter durations (see Fig. Supplementary Fig. 1b). Moreover, we found that imaging for longer did not yield more analyzable cells because most cells had divided after that time, resulting in micropatterns being covered by more than one cell. We also determined the optimal frame rate that allowed us to capture at least 3 images during metaphase and the metaphase-anaphase transition. Since frame rates of 6 and 8 min did not differ significantly with respect to the correct detection of spindle positioning in the negative controls, we chose the latter to minimize data storage (see Fig. Supplementary Fig. 1a).  Micropatterned 96-well plates were imaged at 37°C and 5% CO2 using a 10x (0.45NA) objective on the GE InCellAnalyzer 2200 microscope equipped with a sCMOS CCD camera and hardware autofocus. Imaging was conducted every 8 minutes for 24 h, capturing one focal plane with an exposure time of 100 ms, resulting in 180 frames per visual field; 2 visual fields per well were imaged using the Texas red fluorescent channel. 

HCS Data Analysis Protocol - The imaging data was analysed initially using TRACMIT and then with the help of a custom KNIME workflow. In the first round, we screened 16 96-well plates and could include all of them in the final analysis based on them having an rSSMD >2 (see below). In the second round, we had to repeat the screening of 6 plates for the following reasons. In one case, we encountered a microscope focus issue. In another case, the majority of cells were dead. In two other cases, the number of cells to analyze was particularly low. In the two last cases, we repeated the screening for the same reason but finally did not include the repeated plates since they harbored even less analyzable cells than in the first pass. We realized that cell fitness was generally worse in the second screening round, as reflected by the slightly lower numbers or analyzable cells, as well as the initial shape of cells, as imaged by bright field microscopy. One plausible explanation is that the second batch of imaging plates contained a different glue that may have yielded a modest level of cytotoxicity.  In order to determine if the data collected from each plate meets quality requirements35, we calculated the robust (r) SSMD (strictly standardized median difference) in each case, as follows: (1) rSSMD = (median(Cpos) – median(Cneg)) / ([MAD(Cpos)] ^2 + ([MAD(Cneg)] ^2).  Where Cpos= positive control, Cneg= negative control (Fig. Supplementary Fig. 2c), MAD= median average deviation. As is apparent, rSSMD uses the median instead of the mean and was developed especially for siRNA-based screens with large variability, for which it is more suitable that the Z' score, which is best suited for more streamlined small molecule screens35. According to the rSSMD-based quality control criteria, values between 1 and 2 are considered as inferior, between 2 and 3 as good and over 3 as excellent (criterion 1b in 2,34).  In order to decide how many cells should be analyzed per well to get a meaningful result, we performed a sample size calculation based on randomly picked replicates of negative and positive control wells, using plates for which 3 replicates were available. We used data from cells in 10 wells over three biological replicates and calculated their group means (10 for control siRNA and 25 for LGN siRNA), as well as the mean standard deviation between the screen replicates (5.7 for LGN siRNA and 2.7 for control siRNA). Based on this calculation, at least 8 cells per condition should be analyzed to obtain a meaningful result73. This could be confirmed by plotting mean and standard deviations of negative and positive control wells as a function of the number of cells per well (Fig. Supplementary Fig. 1h).  Hits were selected as summarized in Figure 2 and described in the main text. In the first step, 14 candidates were excluded because no dividing cells were present in either round (PSMB3, PSMA3, GSK3B, PRSS12, PLK1 PIK3R2, BUB1B -most likely essential genes or genes critical for cell cycle progression), or at least in one of the two rounds (FLJ90650, CTSO, DGKH, PRKAG3, FLT3, CTDSP1, PKN3). The latter group of 7 genes originates from different plates, which made it unpractical to repeat the corresponding full plates.  Candidate spindle positioning genes were identified using a step-wise procedure (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 1, Methods). In a first step, 14 genes were excluded because no cells were present in at least one round of screening, leaving 1266 genes for further analysis. Second, we set an empiric cut off at ≥30% of cells having to exhibit abnormal spindle positioning when combining the numbers from both screening rounds. We choose ≥30% to select candidates with strong spindle positioning phenotypes; LGN siRNA has a relatively weak phenotype, with ~ 26% of cells (±10%, n=256 wells) exhibiting abnormal spindle positioning2 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This second filter left 231 genes to consider further (Fig. 2b). Third, we excluded 131 of these genes because their depletion led to abnormal spindle positioning in ≥30% of cells in only one of the two screening rounds. Fourth, movies corresponding to the two rounds for the remaining 100 genes were inspected manually. This led to the exclusion of 84 genes that were false positives owing to single cells being poorly located on the micropatterns, or else to more than one cell being present on one micropattern32. Overall, the above step-wise procedure led to the identification of 16 candidates spindle positioning genes (Fig. 2a-c). Representative movie sequences during mitosis following depletion of these 16 components are reported in Supplementary Figure 3.  The 16 candidate genes comprised 5 genes that were described previously as having an impact on spindle positioning in mammalian cells. These are the kinases Aurora A15,16 and PLK218, as well as the phosphatase PPP2CA12. As anticipated, the screen also identified PLK4, whose depletion causes impaired centriole duplication, thereby resulting in spindle pole asymmetry and aberrant spindle positioning36. Moreover, we identified the Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK), which is required for positioning the meiotic spindle in the mouse oocyte37. In addition to these 5 genes, another 5 that might have been expected to be identified based on previous work did not meet the stringent criteria of the above step-wise procedure (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, we identified 5/10 of the genes that were expected from prior work to be associated with a spindle positioning phenotype. By extension, we estimate the false negative discovery rate of the present screen to be ~50%. Overall, we conclude that our live imaging screening pipeline has identified 16 candidate modulators of spindle positioning in human cells.
